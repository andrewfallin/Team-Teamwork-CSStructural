# Team-Teamwork-CSStructural

# Washington State University CptS 422

## Description
This project consists of extending on the Eclipse CheckStyle plugin to detect structural metrics.

The following structural metrics are to be tracked: 

• Halstead Length is the sum of the total number of operators and operand [1,2]

• Halstead Vocabulary is the sum of the number of unique operators and unique operands [1,2]

• Halstead Volume is the program length (N) times the log2 of the program vocabulary (n) [1,2] : Volume = N log2 n

• Halstead Difficulty is half of the unique operators multiplied by the total number of operands, divided by the number of distinct operators [1,2]

• Halstead Effort is the difficulty multiplied by the volume. Effort = DV. Effort was intended as a suggestion for how long code review might take [1,2]

• ~~Number of comments [3]~~ Matt

• ~~Number of lines of comments [3]~~ Matt

• Number of looping statements [3]

• Number of operators [3]

• Number of operands [3]

• Number of expressions [3]

• ~~Number of variable declarations [4]~~ Matt

• External Method references are the number of methods called from an external class [4] Matt

• Local method references are the number of methods called from the same class [4] Matt

• Number of casts 

• Maintainability Index measures how maintainable the source code is.

  *A large amount of project commits are from matthew changing/moving git directories and readme's. Need only count code upload commits for deliverable 1. Matt used the GitHub Web client to do this. Dont be a matt. Use the command line.*
