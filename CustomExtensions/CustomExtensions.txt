DO NOT PUT checkstyle-metadata.xml, checkstyle-metadata.properties, messages.properties, or sample_checks.xml HERE. 
Each file here should be a class.
There does not need to be 14+ files (classes) here. Aim to cram as much logic into one class as possible as we defined in our design docs. Alternatively, we can put 14+ classes in here then just combine them into a fatty at the end.
Your file should be named accordingly to your class.
Cross out what you have done from the readme if your check is functional.
